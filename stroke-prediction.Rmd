## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
read.csv("/Users/seokhwanhong/Desktop/Statistics/Project/Project 2/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv") -> data_set
```

```{r}
filter(data_set, bmi != 'N/A') -> data_set
```

```{r}
as.numeric(data_set$bmi) -> data_set$bmi
```



```{r}
mod = lm(stroke ~ bmi + age + bmi*age, data = data_set)
summary(mod)
```





```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
